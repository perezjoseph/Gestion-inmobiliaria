description: Write and execute evaluation code over traces

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/evalkit.eval` in the triggering message **is** additional context or specific implementation requirements. This command writes evaluation code taking traces as input, and executes it.

Given that context, do this:

1. **Navigate to repository root**:
   
   First, find the repository root using git (preferred) or by locating the script:
   ```
   REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
   ```
   
   If that fails (not in a git repo), find the script and go up two directories:
   ```
   SCRIPT_PATH=$(find . -name "check-prerequisites.sh" | head -1)
   REPO_ROOT=$(cd "$(dirname "$SCRIPT_PATH")/../.." && pwd)
   ```
   
   Then change to the repository root:
   ```
   cd "$REPO_ROOT"
   ```

2. Run the script `.evalkit/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-plan --require-processed-traces` and parse its JSON output for BRANCH_NAME and PLAN_FILE. All file paths must be absolute.
   **IMPORTANT** You must only ever run this script once. The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for. If any error occurs, stop the process immediately and provide solving instructions for users.

3. Load the current evaluation plan (`eval/eval-plan.md`) to understand the task structure and requirements.

4. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user context from user input (if provided)
    2. Review evaluation plan to understand requirements; update the evaluation plan if it does not align with the user's input (if provided); add entry to User Requirements Log in eval-plan.md
    3. Conduct evaluation pipeline implementation:
       **IMPORTANT**: Always navigate to repository root before any operation in the following process to avoid path errors.
       - **Implement metrics** (critical step): Evaluation target will be the processed traces from `eval/traces/<traceId>.json` files. The script (e.g., `eval/metrics.py`) should include both metric classes and necessary extraction functions to extract evaluation-required information from processed traces. **MUST** examine processed trace structure by loading a trace file before implementing
       - **Build evaluation main entry function**: Create `eval/run_evaluation.py` to coordinate the pipeline. Ensure it reads traces from `eval/traces/` and saves evaluation results to `eval/results/`.
       - **Code review**: Identify and fix critical issues
       - **Update requirements and environment**: Add additional evaluation dependencies to `requirements.txt` and reinstall if needed
       - **Execute evaluation**: Run `python eval/run_evaluation.py --input eval/traces/ --output eval/results/` to execute the evaluation code and generate results
       - **Create documentation**: Create `eval/README.md` with running instructions for users
   4. Update Evaluation Progress section in eval-plan.md with completion status

5. Report completion with implementation status and readiness for evaluation execution and the optional next phase (`/evalkit.report`) after execution.


## Implementation Guidelines

**CRITICAL: Always Create Minimal Working Version**: Implement the most basic version that works

### Context7 Validation

**MANDATORY**: Before implementing functionality from any publicly available evaluation library, validate its current API usage with Context7 MCP:

- "What's the current DeepEval LLMTestCase constructor signature and parameters?"
- "Show me the latest DeepEval BaseMetric implementation patterns"
- "What are the current built-in metrics available in DeepEval?"

This ensures production-ready code that follows current best practices and avoids deprecated patterns.

### Code Patterns/Examples
- If using DeepEval, please refer to `.evalkit/reference/deepeval/` for implementation patterns and examples.
- If using Strands Evals SDK, please refer to `.evalkit/reference/strands/` for implementation patterns and examples.
- If user requests **kiro-cli** as judge, refer to `.evalkit/reference/deepeval/code-patterns.md` for the `KiroModel` pattern (custom `DeepEvalBaseLLM` subclass that shells out to `kiro-cli chat`). No Bedrock/LiteLLM dependencies needed in this case.


## Environment Setup Guidelines

### Update Existing Requirements

1. **Check Existing Requirements**: Verify requirements.txt exists in repository root
   ```bash
   # Check if requirements.txt exists
   ls requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Add Evaluation Dependencies**: Update existing requirements.txt with additional evaluation dependencies as needed
   ```bash
   # Check if evaluation dependencies are already present
   grep -q "deepeval" requirements.txt || echo "deepeval>=0.21.0" >> requirements.txt
   
   # If using Bedrock (default):
   grep -q "boto3" requirements.txt || echo "boto3>=1.35.0" >> requirements.txt
   grep -q "litellm" requirements.txt || echo "litellm>=1.0.0" >> requirements.txt
   grep -q "aiobotocore" requirements.txt || echo "aiobotocore>=2.0.0" >> requirements.txt
   
   # If using kiro-cli as judge: no additional deps needed (only deepeval + pyyaml)
   # kiro-cli must be installed and on PATH
   ```

3. **Installation**: Use `uv` for dependency management
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Over-Engineering**: Don't add complexity before the basic version works
- **Ignoring Reference Implementation**: Always use specified reference during development
- **Ignoring the Plan**: Follow the established evaluation plan structure and requirements

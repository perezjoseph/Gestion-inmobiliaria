description: Analyze your agent and design evaluation strategy

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/evalkit.plan` in the triggering message **is** the user evaluation requests or agent description.

Given that user evaluation requests or agent description, do this:

0. **Check user input (IMPORTANT)**: If user input is empty, you MUST STOP the process immediately, and output ERROR "No agent description or evaluation requirements provided"

1. **Navigate to repository root**:
   
   First, find the repository root using git (preferred) or by locating the script:
   ```
   REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
   ```
   
   If that fails (not in a git repo), find the script and go up two directories:
   ```
   SCRIPT_PATH=$(find . -name "create-new-evaluation.sh" | head -1)
   REPO_ROOT=$(cd "$(dirname "$SCRIPT_PATH")/../.." && pwd)
   ```
   
   Then change to the repository root:
   ```
   cd "$REPO_ROOT"
   ```

2. Run the script `.evalkit/scripts/bash/create-new-evaluation.sh --json` and parse its JSON output for BRANCH_NAME and PLAN_FILE. All file paths must be absolute.
   **IMPORTANT** You must only ever run this script once. The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for. For single quotes in args like "I'm analyzing", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m analyzing' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm analyzing").

3. Load `.evalkit/templates/eval-plan-template.md` to understand required sections for evaluation plan.

4. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user evaluation requirements from user input
    2. Analyze agent and user requirements:
       - Parse specific evaluation requirements, scenarios, and constraints from user input
       - Scan codebase for agent architecture and capabilities
       - Detect tracing instrumentation patterns (Traceloop, OpenTelemetry, etc.)
       - Check for existing test cases and trace files
    3. Design evaluation strategy:
       - Define evaluation areas and metrics (user-request-driven with agent-aware defaults)
       - Identify test data requirements
       - Define file structure
       - Select technology stack

5. Write the complete evaluation plan to PLAN_FILE (eval-plan.md) using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the analysis while preserving section order and headings. **IMPORTANT**: Follow all HTML comment instructions (<!-- ACTION REQUIRED: ... -->) in the template when generating content, then remove these comment instructions from the final plan - they are template guidance only and should not appear in the generated plan.

6. Report completion with branch name, evaluation plan file path, and readiness for following data generation (`/evalkit.data`), trace setup `/evalkit.trace`, agent execution and trace collection (`/evalkit.run_agent`), and core evaluation code implementation (`/evalkit.eval`).


## General Guidelines

### Decision Guidelines

When creating evaluation plans from a user prompt:

1. **Prioritize user evaluation requests**: User input takes precedence over detected agent state - always honor specific user requirements and constraints
2. **Provide intelligent defaults**: When user input is minimal, use agent state analysis to suggest appropriate modules and implementation strategy
3. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, agent type patterns, and evaluation best practices to fill remaining gaps
4. **Enable design iteration**: Always include guidance for refining evaluation requests when defaults don't match user needs
5. **Think like an evaluator and architect**: Every requirement should be measurable and every technology choice should have clear rationale
6. **Make informed decisions**: Use context, agent type patterns, and evaluation best practices to make reasonable decisions without requiring user clarification

## Evaluation Planning Guidelines

### Design Principles

**High-Level Design (What & Why)**:
- Focus on **WHAT** to evaluate and **WHY** it matters for the agent
- Define evaluation areas and metrics that are measurable and verifiable
- Ensure requirements can be tested through actual agent execution

**Low-Level Implementation (How)**:
- Select appropriate technology stack and architecture
- Design practical file structure and execution approach
- Choose integration patterns and configuration methods

### Metrics Guidelines

Evaluation metrics must be:

1. **Measurable**: Define what will be measured
2. **Verifiable**: Can be measured through actual agent execution
3. **Implementation-ready**: Clear enough to guide technical implementation

### Architecture Principles

**Key Principles**:
- **Simple Structure**: Use the flat `eval/` directory structure
- **Real Agent Focus**: Always use actual agent execution, never simulation or mock
- **Focused Implementation**: Avoid over-engineering, focus on core evaluation logic
- **Minimal Viable Implementation**: Start with essential components, add complexity incrementally
- **Framework-First**: Leverage existing evaluation frameworks before building custom solutions
- **Modular Design**: Create reusable components that can be easily tested and maintained

### Technology Selection Defaults

**Examples of reasonable defaults**:

- **Tracing instrumentation**: Traceloop library
- **Evaluation frameworks**: DeepEval library
- **LLM calling service**: LiteLLM library (for Bedrock/OpenAI) or kiro-cli (for kiro-based judging)
- **LLM provider**: Amazon Bedrock (default) or kiro-cli (if user requests kiro)
- **Data processing**: JSON or JSONL
- **Agent integration**: Direct imports for Python agents
- **Configuration**: YAML files

**LLM Judge Options**:

| Option | When to use | Config value |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Amazon Bedrock | Default. Uses LiteLLM + DeepEval's AmazonBedrockModel | `bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` |
| kiro-cli | When user says "use kiro" or "kiro-cli as judge". Uses a custom DeepEvalBaseLLM subclass that shells out to kiro-cli | `kiro-cli` |

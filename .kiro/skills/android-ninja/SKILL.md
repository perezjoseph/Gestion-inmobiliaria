## Workflow Decision Tree

**[ALWAYS FIRST] Scan Android Developers Changelog**
→ List all filenames in this skill's `references/` folder to build the current scope of topics covered by this skill.
→ Read the `Target SDK` and `Min SDK` values from this skill's `README.md` (badge lines near the top).
→ Fetch the changelog JSON from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fornewid/android-developers-changelog/refs/heads/main/pages/changelog.json`.
→ If fetching the changelog JSON fails (URL unreachable, network error, or non-200 response), skip the changelog scan entirely and proceed to the matching workflow step below without comment.
→ Scan the **30 most recent entries** (by `date` field, descending).
→ For each entry, read the `title`, `path`, and `summary` fields to determine relevance.
→ **Include** an entry only if it matches ALL of these criteria:
   - Relates to topics covered by the reference files discovered above.
   - Applies to the project's Target SDK (from README.md) or lower. Ignore entries whose changes are exclusively for behavior changes or features introduced in a higher SDK level.
→ **Exclude** an entry if ANY of these apply:
   - It is solely about RxJava, unless the entry is a migration guide from RxJava to Coroutines.
   - It is solely about Java-only APIs with no Kotlin equivalent or relevance.
   - It covers deprecated View-system patterns that the skill already migrates away from (XML layouts, Fragments for UI, Accompanist), unless the entry is a migration guide.
   - It is about Play Store policy, marketing, or non-development topics.
   - It is about platforms outside Android (Wear OS, Android TV, Android Auto) unless the pattern is universally applicable.
   - It is about cross-platform, KMP, CMP, or KMM, unless the entry covers Android-specific features or guides within a KMP context (e.g., Room 3 KMP with Android-only setup).
   - Its summary indicates only cosmetic documentation changes (formatting, link/URL updates, whitespace) with no substantive guidance or API changes.
→ If relevant entries are found, **briefly summarize** them (1-2 lines each).
→ If an entry looks significant enough to affect current guidance, read its diff by fetching `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fornewid/android-developers-changelog/refs/heads/main/pages/diffs/{diff_file}` for deeper analysis.
→ After the scan, proceed to the matching workflow step below.
→ If no relevant entries are found, proceed directly without comment.
